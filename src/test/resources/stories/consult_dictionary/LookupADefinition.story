Lookup a definition
Narrative:
In order to talk better
As an English student
I want to look up word definitions
Given the user is on the http://www.weather-forecast.com/ home page
When you input <capital> name in the search input
And proper <country> will be selected
Then Temperature for today will be printed
Then Change to F and print


Examples:
|capital|country|
|Kiev|Ukraine|
